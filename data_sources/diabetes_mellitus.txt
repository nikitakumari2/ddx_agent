Type 2 diabetes is a chronic condition that affects the way the body processes blood sugar (glucose). Symptoms often develop slowly over several years and can include increased thirst and frequent urination, increased hunger, unintended weight loss, fatigue, blurred vision, slow-healing sores, and frequent infections.
