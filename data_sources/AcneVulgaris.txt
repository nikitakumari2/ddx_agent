Acne is a skin condition that occurs when your hair follicles become plugged with oil and dead skin cells. It causes whiteheads, blackheads or pimples. Acne is most common among teenagers, though it affects people of all ages. Common Symptoms: Whiteheads (closed plugged pores); blackheads (open plugged pores); small red, tender bumps (papules); pimples with pus at their tips (pustules); large, painful lumps under the skin (nodules or cystic lesions).
