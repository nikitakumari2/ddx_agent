A type of inflammatory arthritis that primarily causes chronic inflammation of the joints and ligaments of the spine. Over time, this inflammation can lead to the fusion of vertebrae, which can cause a loss of spinal mobility and a hunched-forward posture. It can also affect other joints and, in some people, organs like the eyes. Common Symptoms: The hallmark symptom is chronic, dull pain and stiffness in the lower back and hips, which is typically worse in the morning and after periods of inactivity. The pain often improves with exercise and worsens with rest. Other symptoms include fatigue, pain in the rib cage, and inflammation of the eyes (uveitis or iritis).
