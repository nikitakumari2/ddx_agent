A chronic inflammatory lung disease that causes obstructed airflow from the lungs. The two most common conditions that contribute to COPD are emphysema and chronic bronchitis. The main cause is long-term exposure to irritants like tobacco smoke. Common Symptoms: Shortness of breath, especially during physical activity; a chronic cough that may produce large amounts of mucus (sputum); wheezing; chest tightness; frequent respiratory infections; and lack of energy.
