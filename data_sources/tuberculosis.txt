Tuberculosis is a serious infectious disease that mainly affects the lungs. The bacteria that cause TB are spread from person to person through tiny droplets released into the air via coughs and sneezes. Symptoms of active TB include a persistent cough lasting three weeks or more, coughing up blood or mucus, chest pain, unintentional weight loss, fatigue, fever, and night sweats.
