Allergic rhinitis is a condition that causes allergy symptoms such as sneezing, a stuffy or runny nose, and itchy, watery eyes. These symptoms occur when you breathe in something you are allergic to, such as dust, animal dander, or pollen. Unlike a cold, hay fever is not caused by a virus. Also known as Hay Fever.
