Hypertension (High Blood Pressure): Hypertension is a common condition in which the long-term force of the blood against your artery walls is high enough that it may eventually cause health problems, such as heart disease. Blood pressure is determined both by the amount of blood your heart pumps and the amount of resistance to blood flow in your arteries. The more blood your heart pumps and the narrower your arteries, the higher your blood pressure. Often called the "silent killer" because it typically has no symptoms. In cases of a hypertensive crisis (severely high blood pressure), individuals might experience headaches, shortness of breath, or nosebleeds.
