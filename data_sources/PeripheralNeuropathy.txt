Peripheral neuropathy is a condition resulting from damage to the peripheral nerves, which are the nerves outside of the brain and spinal cord. This damage disrupts the nerves' ability to send signals, affecting how the body feels sensations and moves muscles. It can be caused by various conditions, with diabetes being the most common cause in the United States. Common Symptoms: Symptoms depend on which nerves are affected (sensory, motor, or autonomic) but often include: A gradual onset of numbness, prickling, or a "pins and needles" feeling (paresthesia), typically in the hands and feet. Sharp, jabbing, throbbing, or burning pain. Extreme sensitivity to touch. Muscle weakness, lack of coordination, and an increased tendency to fall.
