Oral Herpes (Cold Sores / Fever Blisters) is a common viral infection caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV-1). It results in small, fluid-filled blisters that form on or around the lips. The virus is contagious and can be spread through close personal contact, such as kissing.

Common Symptoms:

A tingling, itching, or burning sensation on the lip for a day or so before the sore appears.

The appearance of small, painful, fluid-filled blisters.

The blisters eventually break, ooze, and then form a yellow crust or scab that heals over several days.
