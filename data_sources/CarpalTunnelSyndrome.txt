Carpal tunnel syndrome is a condition that causes numbness, tingling, or weakness in your hand. It happens because of pressure on your median nerve, which runs the length of your arm, goes through a passage in your wrist called the carpal tunnel, and ends in your hand. Common Symptoms: Numbness, tingling, burning, and pain in the thumb and index, middle, and ring fingers; weakness in the hand and difficulty gripping objects; pain or tingling that may travel up the forearm.
