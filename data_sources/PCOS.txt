A common hormonal disorder among women of reproductive age. In PCOS, the ovaries may develop numerous small collections of fluid (follicles) and fail to regularly release eggs, often leading to irregular periods and elevated levels of male hormones (androgens). Common Symptoms: Irregular, infrequent, or prolonged menstrual cycles; excess androgen levels leading to excess facial and body hair (hirsutism), severe acne, and male-pattern baldness; weight gain.
