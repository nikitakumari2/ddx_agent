Anxiety is a normal emotion. It’s your brain’s way of reacting to stress and alerting you of potential danger ahead. However, anxiety disorders are different. They are a group of mental illnesses that cause constant and overwhelming anxiety and fear. The excessive anxiety can make you avoid work, school, family get-togethers, and other social situations that might trigger or worsen your symptoms. Common Symptoms: Feeling nervous, restless, or tense; having a sense of impending danger, panic, or doom; increased heart rate; rapid breathing (hyperventilation); sweating; trembling; difficulty concentrating or thinking about anything other than the present worry.
