Kidney stones are hard deposits made of minerals and salts that form inside the kidneys. They can cause severe pain in the side and back, below the ribs. The pain may radiate to the lower abdomen and groin and may come in waves. Other symptoms include painful urination, pink, red, or brown urine, and nausea and vomiting.
