Heart failure, sometimes known as congestive heart failure, occurs when the heart muscle doesn't pump blood as well as it should. Certain conditions, such as narrowed arteries in your heart (coronary artery disease) or high blood pressure, gradually leave your heart too weak or stiff to fill and pump efficiently. Common Symptoms: Shortness of breath during daily activities or when lying down; fatigue and weakness; swelling (edema) in legs, ankles, and feet; rapid or irregular heartbeat; persistent cough or wheezing.
