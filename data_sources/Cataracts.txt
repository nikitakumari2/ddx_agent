A cataract is a clouding of the normally clear lens of the eye, which can impair vision. It's a very common condition, especially in older adults, and develops as proteins in the lens break down and clump together, making the lens cloudy. Common Symptoms: Clouded, blurred, or dim vision, often described as looking through a frosty window. Increasing difficulty with vision at night. Sensitivity to light and glare. Seeing "halos" around lights. Fading or yellowing of colors.
