Shingles is a viral infection that causes a painful rash. It is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, the same virus that causes chickenpox. The primary symptom is a painful, blistering rash that usually appears as a single stripe on either the left or right side of the torso. Other symptoms include burning, tingling, or numbness of the skin, and sensitivity to touch.
