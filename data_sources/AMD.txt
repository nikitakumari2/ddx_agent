Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) is a common eye condition and a leading cause of vision loss for those aged 50 and older. It damages the macula, the part of the retina needed for sharp, central vision, which lets us see objects that are straight ahead. Common Symptoms: A gradual or sudden blurring of central vision. Straight lines appearing wavy or distorted. Dark, blurry areas or a blind spot in the center of vision. Colors appearing less bright than they used to.
