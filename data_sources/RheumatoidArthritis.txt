Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory disorder that can affect more than just your joints. In some people, the condition can damage a wide variety of body systems, including the skin, eyes, lungs, heart and blood vessels. An autoimmune disorder, rheumatoid arthritis occurs when your immune system mistakenly attacks your own body's tissues. Common Symptoms: Tender, warm, swollen joints; joint stiffness that is usually worse in the mornings and after inactivity; fatigue, fever, and loss of appetite. Often affects the same joints on both sides of the body.
