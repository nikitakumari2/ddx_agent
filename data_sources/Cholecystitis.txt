Cholecystitis is inflammation of the gallbladder. The gallbladder is a small, pear-shaped organ on the right side of the abdomen, beneath the liver. The gallbladder holds a digestive fluid that's released into the small intestine (bile). In most cases, gallstones blocking the tube leading out of your gallbladder cause cholecystitis. Common Symptoms: Severe pain in your upper right or center abdomen; pain that spreads to your right shoulder or back; tenderness over your abdomen when it's touched; nausea; vomiting; fever.
