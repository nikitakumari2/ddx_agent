Atopic dermatitis (eczema) is a condition that makes your skin red and itchy. It's common in children but can occur at any age. Atopic dermatitis is long lasting (chronic) and tends to flare periodically. It may be accompanied by asthma or hay fever. Common Symptoms: Dry, itchy skin; red to brownish-gray patches, especially on the hands, feet, ankles, wrists, neck, and inside the bend of the elbows and knees; small, raised bumps that may leak fluid and crust over when scratched.
