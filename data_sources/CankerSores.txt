Canker Sores (Aphthous Ulcers) are small, painful, shallow ulcers that appear inside the mouth on the soft tissues, such as the inside of the lips, cheeks, or on the tongue. They are not contagious and their exact cause is often unknown, but triggers can include stress, minor mouth injuries, and certain foods.

Common Symptoms:

A round or oval sore that is white or yellowish with a red border.

A tingling or burning sensation that may occur a day or two before the sore appears.

Pain that can make eating and talking uncomfortable.
