Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is a virus that attacks the bodyâ€™s immune system, specifically the CD4 cells (T cells). If left untreated, HIV can lead to the disease Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS), the most advanced stage of infection. Early-stage (acute) symptoms can be flu-like, including fever, chills, rash, night sweats, and fatigue. The chronic stage is often asymptomatic. Late-stage symptoms (AIDS) include rapid weight loss, recurring fever, prolonged swelling of lymph glands, and opportunistic infections due to a severely damaged immune system.
