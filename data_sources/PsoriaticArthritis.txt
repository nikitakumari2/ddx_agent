It is an autoimmune condition in which the immune system attacks healthy joints and skin. Common Symptoms: Joint pain, stiffness, and swelling that can affect any joint in the body, including the fingertips and spine. Other key signs include "sausage-like" swelling of the fingers or toes (dactylitis), changes to the nails (pitting or separation from the nail bed), and foot pain, especially at the back of the heel.
