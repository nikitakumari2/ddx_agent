Diverticulosis is a condition that occurs when small pouches, or sacs, form and push outward through weak spots in the wall of your colon. When diverticulosis causes symptoms, bleeding, inflammation, or complications, doctors call this condition diverticular disease. Symptoms of diverticular disease may include constipation, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or bloating. Diverticulitis most often causes abdominal pain, which is usually severe. Experts are not sure what causes these conditions.
