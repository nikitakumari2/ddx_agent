Gingivitis is the early, mild stage of gum disease, causing inflammation of the gums. If left untreated, it can advance to Periodontitis, a serious infection that damages the soft tissue and bone that support the teeth, potentially leading to tooth loss.

Common Symptoms:

Gingivitis: Red, swollen, and tender gums that bleed easily when brushing or flossing.

Periodontitis: In addition to gingivitis symptoms, signs include gums that pull away (recede) from the teeth, persistent bad breath, loose teeth, and changes in the way your teeth fit together when you bite.
