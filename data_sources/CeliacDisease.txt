 A chronic digestive and immune disorder that damages the small intestine. The disease is triggered by eating foods containing gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. It prevents the absorption of some nutrients (malabsorption). Common Symptoms: Digestive issues such as chronic diarrhea, constipation, gas, bloating, and abdominal pain. Non-digestive symptoms can be more common in adults and include unexplained iron-deficiency anemia, fatigue, bone or joint pain, loss of bone density (osteoporosis), and an itchy, blistery skin rash called dermatitis herpetiformis.
