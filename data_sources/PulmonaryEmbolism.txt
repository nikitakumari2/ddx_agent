A pulmonary embolism is a blockage in one of the pulmonary arteries in your lungs. In most cases, pulmonary embolism is caused by blood clots that travel to the lungs from deep veins in the legs or, rarely, from veins in other parts of the body (deep vein thrombosis). Common Symptoms: Sudden unexplained shortness of breath; sharp chest pain, especially when you take a deep breath or cough; coughing up blood; rapid or irregular heartbeat; lightheadedness or dizziness.
