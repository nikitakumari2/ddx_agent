Atrial fibrillation, often called AFib or AF, is the most common type of treated heart arrhythmia. An arrhythmia is when the heart beats too slowly, too fast, or in an irregular way.When a person has AFib, the normal beating in the upper chambers of the heart (the two atria) is irregular, and blood doesn't flow as well as it should from the atria to the lower chambers of the heart (the two ventricles). AFib may happen in brief episodes, or it may be a permanent condition.Some individuals have no symptoms. When present, they can include palpitations (a feeling of a fast-beating, fluttering, or pounding heart), shortness of breath, weakness or fatigue, chest pain, and dizziness or fainting.
