Psoriasis is a skin disease that causes red, itchy scaly patches, most commonly on the knees, elbows, trunk and scalp. Psoriasis is a common, long-term (chronic) disease with no cure. It tends to go through cycles, flaring for a few weeks or months, then subsiding for a while or going into remission. Common Symptoms: Patches of thick, red skin with silvery scales (plaques); dry, cracked skin that may bleed or itch; itching, burning, or soreness; thickened or pitted nails.
