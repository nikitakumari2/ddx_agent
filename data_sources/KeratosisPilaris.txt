Keratosis pilaris is a very common and harmless skin condition that causes dry, rough patches and tiny bumps, usually on the upper arms, thighs, cheeks, or buttocks. It is caused by the buildup of keratin—a hard protein that protects the skin—which forms a plug that blocks the opening of a hair follicle. It is not contagious.

Common Symptoms: Painless, tiny bumps that create a rough, "sandpaper-like" texture on the skin. The bumps may be skin-colored, white, red, or brownish. Dryness in the affected areas.
The condition often worsens during the winter months when the air is dry and may improve in warmer, more humid weather.
