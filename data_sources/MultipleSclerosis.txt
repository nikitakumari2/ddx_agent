 Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a potentially disabling disease of the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system). In MS, the immune system attacks the protective sheath (myelin) that covers nerve fibers and causes communication problems between your brain and the rest of your body. Common Symptoms: Numbness or weakness in one or more limbs (often on one side of the body at a time); partial or complete loss of vision, usually in one eye at a time; fatigue; slurred speech; lack of coordination or an unsteady gait.
