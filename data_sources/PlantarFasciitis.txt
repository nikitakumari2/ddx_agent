It involves the inflammation of the plantar fascia, which is the thick band of tissue that runs across the bottom of your foot, connecting your heel bone to your toes. Common Symptoms: A sharp, stabbing pain in the bottom of the foot near the heel. The pain is typically most severe with the first few steps in the morning or after long periods of rest. It may decrease during the day but can return after long periods of standing or upon standing up after sitting.
