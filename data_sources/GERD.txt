Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) occurs when stomach acid frequently flows back into the tube connecting your mouth and stomach (esophagus). This backwash (acid reflux) can irritate the lining of your esophagus. Common Symptoms: A burning sensation in your chest (heartburn), usually after eating; regurgitation of food or sour liquid; difficulty swallowing; sensation of a lump in your throat; chronic cough.
