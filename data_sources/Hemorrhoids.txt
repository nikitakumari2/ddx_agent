Swollen and inflamed veins in the anus and lower rectum. They can be internal (inside the rectum) or external (under the skin around the anus) and are very common, often resulting from straining during bowel movements or from increased pressure during pregnancy. Common Symptoms: The most common sign is painless, bright red bleeding during or after a bowel movement. Other symptoms include itching or irritation in the anal region, pain or discomfort, swelling around the anus, and a sensitive or painful lump near the anus.
