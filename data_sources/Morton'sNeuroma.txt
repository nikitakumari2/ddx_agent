Morton's neuroma is a painful condition affecting the ball of your foot, most commonly the area between the third and fourth toes. It involves a thickening of the tissue around one of the nerves leading to your toes, causing sharp, burning pain. The condition often results from irritation, pressure, or injury to the nerve. Common Symptoms: A persistent feeling of standing on a pebble or a fold in your sock. A sharp, burning, or shooting pain in the ball of the foot that can radiate into the toes. Tingling or numbness in the toes. Symptoms are often worsened by wearing tight, narrow, or high-heeled shoes and are typically relieved by removing footwear and massaging the foot.
