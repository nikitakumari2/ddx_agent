Appendicitis is the inflammation of the appendix. It causes a sudden pain that begins on the right side of the lower abdomen. The pain often starts around the navel and then moves. Other symptoms include nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, a low-grade fever that may worsen as the illness progresses, and abdominal bloating.
