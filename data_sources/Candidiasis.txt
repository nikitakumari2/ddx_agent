An infection caused by an overgrowth of the Candida fungus, which normally lives in the mouth. It is common in infants, denture wearers, and individuals with weakened immune systems or those taking certain medications like antibiotics or inhaled steroids.
Common Symptoms:

Creamy white, slightly raised patches on the tongue, inner cheeks, roof of the mouth, or tonsils.

Redness, burning, or soreness that may make it difficult to eat or swallow.

A "cotton-like" feeling in the mouth.

Slight bleeding if the white patches are scraped.
