Fibromyalgia is a disorder characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain accompanied by fatigue, sleep, memory and mood issues. Researchers believe that fibromyalgia amplifies painful sensations by affecting the way your brain processes pain signals. Common Symptoms: Widespread pain (often described as a constant dull ache); fatigue; cognitive difficulties ("fibro fog") that impair focus and concentration; headaches, depression, and pain or cramping in the lower abdomen.
