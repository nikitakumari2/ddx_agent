Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that damage the optic nerve, which connects the eye to the brain. This damage is often caused by abnormally high pressure inside the eye (intraocular pressure) and can lead to irreversible vision loss if not treated.
Common Symptoms: Open-angle glaucoma (most common type): Often called the "silent thief of sight" because it has no symptoms in its early stages. Over time, patchy blind spots develop in the peripheral (side) vision.
Acute angle-closure glaucoma (less common): This is a medical emergency. Symptoms appear suddenly and include severe eye pain, headache, nausea, blurred vision, and seeing halos around lights.
