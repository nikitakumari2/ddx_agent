A common inflammation of the eyelids, usually affecting the part where the eyelashes grow. It occurs when the tiny oil glands near the base of the eyelashes become clogged, leading to irritation, redness, and crusting.
Common Symptoms: Red, swollen, and itchy eyelids. A gritty or burning sensation in the eyes. Crusty debris on the eyelashes, especially upon waking. Flaky or scaly skin on the eyelids.
