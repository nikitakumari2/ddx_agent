Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi and rarely, Borrelia mayonii. It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected blacklegged ticks. Typical symptoms include fever, headache, fatigue, and a characteristic skin rash called erythema migrans. The erythema migrans rash occurs in approximately 70 to 80 percent of infected persons and begins at the site of a tick bite after a delay of 3 to 30 days. It expands gradually over several days reaching up to 12 inches or more across. Parts of the rash may clear as it enlarges, resulting in a "bull's-eye" appearance. If left untreated, infection can spread to joints, the heart, and the nervous system. Most cases of Lyme disease can be treated successfully with a few weeks of antibiotics.
