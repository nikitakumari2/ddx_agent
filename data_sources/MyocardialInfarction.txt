A myocardial infarction, commonly known as a heart attack, occurs when the flow of blood to the heart is blocked. The blockage is most often a buildup of fat, cholesterol and other substances, which form a plaque in the arteries that feed the heart (coronary arteries). The interrupted blood flow can damage or destroy part of the heart muscle. Chest pain or discomfort (pressure, squeezing, fullness); pain in the jaw, neck, or back; discomfort in one or both arms or shoulders; shortness of breath; feeling weak, light-headed, or faint; nausea.
