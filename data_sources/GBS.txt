Guillain-Barr√© Syndrome (GBS) is a rare but serious autoimmune disorder where the immune system mistakenly attacks part of the peripheral nervous system. This nerve damage leads to muscle weakness, and in some cases, paralysis. The exact cause is unknown, but it often develops days or weeks after a respiratory or gastrointestinal viral infection.
Common Symptoms: Weakness and tingling sensations that typically start in the legs and spread upward to the arms and upper body (ascending paralysis). Difficulty with walking and coordination. Severe pain, which can be achy, shooting, or cramp-like. Difficulty with facial movements, including speaking, chewing, or swallowing. Problems with heart rate and blood pressure in severe cases.
